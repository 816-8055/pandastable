{"name":"DataFrameViewer","tagline":"Application for plotting and analyzing table data based on the pandastable widget.","body":"## Introduction\r\n\r\nThis application is based on a [ython widget called pandastable which itself is a  frontend to the pandas DataFrame class. The application is intended for educational and scientific use. Currently this focuses on providing a spreadsheet like interface for table manipulation with  configurable 2D/3D plotting. The program is free and open source.\r\n\r\n## Current features\r\n* add, remove rows and columns\r\n* spreadsheet-like drag, shift-click, ctrl-click selection\r\n* edit individual cells\r\n* sort by column, rename columns\r\n* reorder columns dynamically by mouse drags\r\n* set some basic formatting such as font, text size and column width\r\n* save the DataFrame? to supported pandas formats\r\n* import/export of supported text files\r\n* rendering of very large tables is only memory limited\r\n* interactive plots with matplotlib, mostly using the pandas plot functions\r\n\r\n## Future features\r\n* filter table using built in dataframe functionality\r\n* present/manipulate time series data since pandas deals well with this\r\n* graphical way to perform split-apply-combine operations\r\n\r\n<img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmnfarrell/pandastable/master/img/viewerapp.png width=600px>\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
